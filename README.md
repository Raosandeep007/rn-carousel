# Carousel ðŸ‘‹

## How to Set Up and Run the Project

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    yarn start
   ```

## Features implemented

- Animated carousel with infinite scrolling
- Navigate to the next card action.
- Auto-play video when in view
- CTAs change themes based on the active card
- Responsive design

## Any trade-offs or challenges faced

- The CTAs on the page should change theme on each card. However, a fixed theme is used for every card (not able find way to determine the theme based on item contrast).

- Animate text only first time (Animating whenever it's in view).
